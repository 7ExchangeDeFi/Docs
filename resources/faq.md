# FAQ

## General

### What is 7.Exchange?

7.Exchange is a cross-chain DEX aggregator. It connects to multiple bridges, DEXs, and liquidity sources across chains and finds the swap route that delivers the best net output — after accounting for gas, bridge fees, slippage, and MEV risk. It's non-custodial: your funds stay in your wallet until you sign a transaction.

### Do I need to create an account?

No. You can connect your wallet and start swapping immediately. Optionally, you can sign in (by signing a message in your wallet) to unlock additional features like transaction history, leaderboard tracking, and the referral program.

### Which chains are supported?

7.Exchange supports a wide range of EVM and non-EVM networks. The list of supported chains changes as providers are added. See the [Integrations page](https://7.exchange/integrations) for the current live list.

### Which wallets can I use?

7.Exchange supports wallets across EVM (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Rabby, WalletConnect), Solana (Phantom, Solflare), Bitcoin (Xverse, Leather), Sui, and Tron ecosystems. See [Wallets](../supported-infrastructure/wallets.md) for the full list.

## Swapping

### How do I swap?

Connect your wallet, select source and destination tokens, review the available routes, and confirm. For a detailed walkthrough, see [Your First Swap](../getting-started/your-first-swap.md).

### How does 7.Exchange find the best rate?

The routing engine queries all integrated providers simultaneously, simulates each route end-to-end, and ranks them by net output — the actual amount that arrives in your wallet after all fees. See [How Routing Works](../core-concepts/how-routing-works.md) for details.

### Can I swap between different chain types?

Yes. You can swap between EVM chains, between non-EVM chains, and between EVM and non-EVM chains (e.g., Ethereum to Solana). Cross-ecosystem swaps require wallets connected for both ecosystems.

### How long does a swap take?

Same-chain swaps typically confirm in seconds. Cross-chain swaps range from under a minute to several minutes, depending on the chains involved and network conditions. Some combinations with long finality times may take longer. The estimated time is always shown before you confirm.

### What if my swap is stuck?

Cross-chain swaps can take longer than expected during periods of network congestion. If your transaction shows "In progress" for an extended period, wait — most transactions resolve on their own. If it remains unresolved, contact support with your Transaction ID or Quote ID. See [Transaction Tracking](../features/transaction-tracking.md) for more details.

### Can I cancel a swap?

No. Once you sign and broadcast a transaction, it is on-chain and irreversible. 7.Exchange cannot cancel, reverse, or modify on-chain transactions.

## Fees

### What fees does 7.Exchange charge?

A routing fee on each transaction, plus network gas fees, bridge fees, and DEX fees. All costs are displayed in the route preview before you confirm. See [Fees](../core-concepts/fees.md) for a full breakdown.

### Are there hidden fees?

No. Every cost — routing fee, gas, bridge fee, and DEX fee — is factored into the net output shown in the route preview. The amount you see is the amount you should expect to receive, subject to slippage.

### Does the referral program increase my costs?

No. Referral rewards are paid from the platform's routing fee. They do not increase the cost for the referred user.

## Security

### Is 7.Exchange custodial?

No. 7.Exchange is fully non-custodial. The platform never holds, controls, or has access to your funds. Every transaction is signed by you and executed directly through the underlying protocols.

### Will 7.Exchange ask for my private keys?

Never. Any request for private keys or seed phrases is fraudulent and not associated with 7.Exchange.

### What happens if a bridge gets exploited?

7.Exchange routes through third-party bridge protocols. If a bridge is exploited, transactions routed through that bridge may be affected. 7.Exchange cannot recover funds lost due to third-party protocol exploits. The provider-agnostic design means alternative routes through other bridges remain available.

### How do I report a security issue?

Email security findings to [contact@7.exchange](mailto:contact@7.exchange). Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly before resolution. See [Bug Bounty Program](../security/bug-bounty-program.md) for details.

## Referral program

### How do I earn referral rewards?

Sign in, go to the Affiliate page, create a referral link, and share it. You earn a percentage of the routing fee on every swap made by users who signed up through your link. See [Referral Program](../features/referral-program.md) for details.

### Can I have multiple referral links?

Yes. You can create multiple links with different names to track performance across channels (e.g., one for Twitter, one for Discord).

### When can I withdraw my earnings?

Earnings are available for withdrawal from your affiliate dashboard. No minimum threshold or waiting period.
